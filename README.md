### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the co-founder & CTO of [Column Tax](https://github.com/column-tax). Previously I worked at [Waymo](https://github.com/waymo-research), [Pioneer](https://github.com/pioneerdotapp), [Google](https://github.com/google) / [YouTube](https://github.com/youtube), and [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity).

We're working on some really interesting software (think turning 75k-pages of law into code). If you're a programmer interested in this type of work, I'd love to hear from you.
